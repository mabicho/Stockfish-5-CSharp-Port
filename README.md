Stockfish-5-CSharp-Port
=====================

Port of the Stockfish chess engine version 5.0 in the C# language. At this time, all functionality except logging is available. In addition, I had serious doubts about the implementation of the multi-core functionality, it works the most of the time, but sometimes it crashes.
The main objective is to build a C# version for a future chess game written using the Unity 3D framework. All we know that the performance always will be a lot under the original C++ version, at this time the single core version on CPU is just around the 40% of the original version, but performance, velocity and a lot of kilo nodes per second is not the main target. The focus of the future chess game will be fun, not be the best analysis engine ever.
